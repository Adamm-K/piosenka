            The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
            And the circling is worth it.
            Finding beauty in the dissonance.

            There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.
            Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
            I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
            Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.

            Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any
            Sense of compassion
